## About Short-of-Time Index

This is the Short-of-Time Index (**STI**), recording how busy is Wei
at this moment. The index is derived directly from Wei's task
management tool (codename `meta`) and is updated every 15 minutes. A
higher index means being busier right now. So if Wei fails to respond
you in time, give him a moment. He might just be having a really high
Short-of-Time Index right now.
