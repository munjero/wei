title: The encyclopedia of everything
subtitle: How to write just about everything.
---

This chapter is an experiment. It explores the ways of recording an
ordinary life. Recording everything that people do could be boring. The
boredom comes directly from our expectation â€“ we know what will be
happening next. You get up, go to class, have lunch, go to class, have
dinner, and sleep, and another day. Everything is expected. Unexpected
things can happen, but not as often as you want it to be unexpected.
However, as people seek for the unexpected outside of themselves, they
often forget, that they themselves can also be a source of the
unexpected. And this encyclopedia tries to record the unexpected of
ourselves.
