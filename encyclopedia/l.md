## Lojban

*June 13, 2015*

It might remain a mysteries how I met Lojban, but when it happened, I
immediately felt in love with this constructed language because it was
(and still is) so geeky to talk in Lojban, and there was so rare people
could speak this language.

I tried and thought about many things about Lojban, a potential shortcut
to an artificial intelligence, a secret journal system, a voice
recognition application, and many programming languages.

My journey learning this language still goes on. Lojban will always be
the thing I use as a secret code and as an entry to the world.

## Lunar Eclipse

*September 28, 2015*

It was dinner time for a tired day today, and Mahima told us a really
fun story about lunar eclipse.

We were really lucky to experience a lunar eclipse on the ship
yesterday. Although it was at 4 o'clock in the morning, a lot of people
went out to watch it. However, Mahima and her friend were late -- when
they were heading to the deck, the majority of people were already
heading back.

There were a red moon, perfectly round since last night was the
Mid-Autumn Festival.

"Look! It's happening!" One person on the desk shouted. As they all
looked at the moon, a shadow appeared, and became bigger.

However, the shadow soon stopped moving and just stayed there. It was
wired, since this was not how a lunar eclipse should be happening.

Ten minutes later, they concluded that the shadow was caused by clouds.
