## Obsessive Efficiency Disorder

*April 8, 2015*

I first heard about the word "Obsessive Efficiency Disorder" from
Mattias Geniar's
[blog](https://ma.ttias.be/obsessive-efficiency-disorder/). It is
basically that kind of disorder that you can't stop trying to be more
efficient. People may think that trying to be more efficient is always a
good thing. However, it is not when you can't stop. For instance, when
you are tired, you would still be trying to be more efficient, and then
you result in doing easy and unimportant tasks and have totally no time
focus on those important ones (because you can't rest).
