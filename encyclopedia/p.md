## Pop Songs

*March 25, 2015*

My mom loves pop songs. They are those songs that echo the pop culture
of China in 1980s. In my memory, related to my mom, pop songs always
happened together with joy and happiness. Either it was because my mom's
happy, she played pop songs, or it was because she played pop songs,
she's happy. I still remember when she told me how excited it was to see
the Tigers playing in New Year's Gala. However, I always hated pop
songs. They were noisy, and represented a sense of abandoning oneself to
vice. So I often rejected it, and sometimes, angrily powered off the
radio, the TV, or whatever it was playing.

One of my seldom experience of enjoying pop songs was in the TEDActive
conference. I remember in the background it was playing Happy, and
people started to cheer and went on stage to dance. I followed the
crowd, and I can still recall those friendly people and the happy faces.
It was amazing.

I still don't feel like pop songs, but now, they make me think of my
home and my friends.
