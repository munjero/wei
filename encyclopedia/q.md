## Quines

*June 23, 2015*

In computer science, quines are a piece of code that when executed,
output itself. I migrated a program in miniKanren that can generate an
infinite list of quines.

In the past, people tried to compete to write the shortest quines, which
turned out to be a blank program -- when executed, output nothing, which
is identical to the original program -- nothing.
