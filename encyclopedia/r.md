## Rimworld

*June 18, 2015*

I reached the end game of Rimworld today. The spacecraft was launched,
and the team was recused. The game ended by making all team members go
to long sleep and giving away control to an AI system. There's no clue
what the AI will do, however, as the script says:

    Your AI will now try to guide the ship to a safe place. It might deposit you
    on a better planet in this system. Or, it may undertake a centuries-long
    journey to another star. It might even decide to hide under ice on an
    asteroid for a few thousand years, waiting for a better period of history.

    You'll find out when you wake up.

## Recurse Center

*May 18, 2015*

I will be joining Recurse Center in summer, 2015. Recurse Center was
once called "Hacker School", which in my opinion is a much much better
name. However, it seems that media and ordinary people don't like either
the word "hacker" or the word "school". Well, how terrible are their
childhoods...
