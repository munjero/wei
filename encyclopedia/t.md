## Thinking

*June 15, 2015*

Here’s a thing I’m trying to do – whenever I feel nervous, exhausted or
worried, I pause my emotions and ask myself “what the problem is”. The
action of the asking would force me to start thinking. Thanks to
natural, I am able to think, which gives me the strength to overcome
difficulties.

## TEDActive

*March 16, 2015*

In May 2015, people from all over the world came to Whistler to attend
TEDActive. I met a lot of interesting people there. And I can't forget
how friendly, how interesting they are.

## Thiel Summit

*June 7, 2015*

I went to the Thiel Summit in June, 2015. People were young there. They
did great things, without finishing college, or even high school. I
managed to have fun, doing some travelings around San Francisco, meeting
interesting people, and sleeping in comfortable beds.

## Time Travelers

*August 28, 2015*

It is so easy to forget that we are all time travelers. Whenever 60
seconds pass, you will travel through time for 1 minute. Life is pretty
exciting (and short) if you think of it in this way.
