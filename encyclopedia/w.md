## Wei

*September 25, 2015*

Wei is my name. So when I meet a new person, the conversation usually
goes like this:

"Hi, I'm Wei."

"Hei?"

"No, Wei."

"Oh, Weee! Nice to meet you!"

The name has only one syllable, which makes it so easy to remember, but
also often, so easy to be mixed with other usages. For examples, people
often say "Wait! Wait! Wait!" to call up others to wait for them, or say
"Weeeeeee!" to express their boredom or excitement. In both cases, they
sound exactly the same as "Wei".
