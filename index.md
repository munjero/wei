## About this website

In this website, I talk about "real" stuff, or anything that involves
me (that is, "Wei Tang"). I write about computer science, philosophy,
and occasionally about art and music.

Besides, if you want to know more about me:

- Above all, meet me in person! Ask me if you want to know where I
  live.
- I currently work as a **core developer** for **Parity
  Technologies**.
- As the Polkadot network is launching, I **intend to validate** on
  the network. You can read more about [the validator
  setup]({% link validate.md %}).
- Send me [an email](mailto:wei@that.world) and follow me on
  [Mastodon](https://social.that.world/@wei).
- For most of my time, I develop softwares. So check out some of
  the [source code](https://source.that.world) and
  my [Github](https://github.com/sorpaas).
