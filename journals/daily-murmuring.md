title: Daily Murmuring
subtitle: A soft, low, or indistinct sound.

This is the part to record things that are not that important, but fun to write
about. You will find short reflections, daily recordings, complaints and
meaningless words. Its meaninglessness echoes with the one of life, somethinng
that we are usually too obsessed about. Well, as sad as it seems to be,
murmuring is actually of a lot of fun.
