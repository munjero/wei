title: Moving
subtitle: Now It's Called That World

*April 6, 2016*

There's no particular reason for this, but I've just moved my blog from *Beyond
Codes* to *That World*. It is considered "moving", involving migrating my
servers, domains, emails, databases, and all complicated stuff you can imagine.

I used to like this kind of moving. "Fresh start", I would usually call it. I
dispose old stuff, refresh everything, and *poof*, everything became new. I then
apply new ideas without the burden of the old ones.

But then I realized that I seldom finished anything. Moving cuts off all what I
was working on, and forces me to start new ones, from beginning, with all
progresses lost.

So now I'm moving with caution.
