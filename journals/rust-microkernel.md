title: Writing a Microkernel in Rust
subtitle: It's Called Rux.

I am writing a microkernel called Rux. It is a L4-family microkernel implemented
in Rust. And this is the journal that records my experiences in implementing it.
In general, writing something like a kernel is addictive -- you just don't want
to stop when you start, and it is far more enjoyable that I previously thought
it would be.
