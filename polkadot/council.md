title: Wei's Polkadot council profile
subtitle: Intent to run for council on Polkadot
---

## Introduction

**Wei** is a core developer working at Parity Technologies. Wei works
on Substrate's consensus engine (BABE and Sassafras) and the
Ethereum-compatibility layer for Substrate. Wei also maintains the
[Core Paper](https://corepaper.org) documentation site.

## Principle

Wei believes in *consistency* and focus on *long-term
solutions*. Consistent goverance brings trust to users, as it allows
people to know what can be expected next. Wei wants to promote
*diversity*, avoiding echo chambers. A short-term plan is to propose
to Polkadot's ecosystem to organize regular events similar to Monero's
weekly *Skepticism Sunday* for open discussions about things that it
hasn't done well in.

Wei also firmly believes that *voting is only the last step of
democracy*. Detailed discussions and community engagements are
essential before voting, in order to better understand the proposals,
look into any potential issues, and avoid unnecessary contentions.

## Agenda

Things related to community engagement that Wei wants to do in
Polkadot:

* Propose and promote Polkadot's version of *Skepticism Sunday*, where
  we can openly discuss things that we haven't done well in regularly.
* And more to be added later!
