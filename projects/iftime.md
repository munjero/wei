This project solves a simple problem. Suppose you want to tell all your
friends that you are away, when you are not on the Internet for 7 days,
how do you do that?

Well, you can spend a day and write a simple program to do that, but it
takes time. Can we simply tell the computer to do that using the above
two simple sentences? The answer is yes, if you know how to use Iftime.
