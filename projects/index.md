title: Codes are languages
subtitle: And computers are people, too.

There are usually three important things involved in writing a program
-- the programmer, the machine, and the user. Programmers write codes,
and codes are used to talk with the machines -- to be able to deliver
the correct the result -- the users -- to communicate the result
clearly -- and the programmers -- to make other programmers
understand. This chapter introduces a portion of my open source
projects of importance.  It tries to make both technical and
non-technical readers understand what those projects do.

Not all projects are introduced here. For a complete list, check out my
