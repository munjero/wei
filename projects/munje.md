Munje, which in Lojban, means the universe. A universe may be something
infinite (well, probably in another universe rather than the one we are
currently living in), so this may be a project that will never be
finished.

The basic idea is to try to create a programming language that uses as
less concepts as possible. A "ordinary" programming may have more than
20 reserved keywords, while in Munje, there's only 5, and most of them
are just for structural purposes.

Programming usually involves defining concepts based on existing
concepts, and when you program in Munje, you don't have a lot existing
concepts. As a result, you usually need to "define things by usage". For
example, I can't say "a knife is a thing that has a certain shape that
is made of wood and metals" because it requires a lot of work to define
"shape", "wood", "metals" and other concepts in the beginning. In Munje,
I define "knife" by using it to cut a food.

Munje also allows you to reason with time. You don't need to say in
order that "you need to do action 1, and then do action 2". Instead, you
can say, "you need to do action 1 before action 2 in order to complete
this task". And when you forget something, you can later say that "and
don't forget action 3!". In this way, you can structure a program based
on **how you think** rather than **how a computer thinks**.
