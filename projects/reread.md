title: Reread
subtitle: Article Recommendation.
---

When you want to read articles on the Internet, how do you decide what
to read next? If you use Reread to read something, it will learn your
reading preference (by your clicking 'like' or 'dislike' button), and
then decide which article to display next based on the preference it has
just learned.

Interested? Go to the [README](https://git.beyond.codes/reread/about/) and learn
how to deploy your own Reread instance.
