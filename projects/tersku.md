subtitle: Lojban Speech Recognition.
---

Lojban is an artificial language, or a constructed language (conlang).
It is really easy to learn, and one of its important features is that
its pronunciations are designed to be distinguishable and unique. Lojban
is of course designed for daily use, for human to human communication.
At the same time, it is one of the best choice if you want to talk with
the future generations of human beings -- artificial intelligence.

However, we are still a bit far away from this dream. Community efforts
have been drawn to design grammar parsers, but we lack a speech
recognition tool that translate sounds into texts, and this project
tries to solve that problem.
