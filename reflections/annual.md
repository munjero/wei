2014
----

From last year, I started to write a Year In Review post at the end of
each year to record some thoughts I have about the world. As it has been
the end of 2014, I decided to write another one.

### Project Nsmg

This year, I started [Project Nsmg](http://ns.mg). The progress is a bit
slow because I can only work part time. The [Speech Recognition for
Lojban](https://ns.mg/Speech_Recognition_for_Lojban) has gained a little
attention in Lojban community and the
[Reread](http://github.com/sorpaas/reread) news reader has gained 100+
stars at Github. Thanks everyone who has paied attention or contributed
to those projects!

### SnapViva and AppWorks

Joining [SnapViva](http://snapviva.com) is really a fascinating
experience. I am really glad to get the opportunity to go to
[AppWorks](http://appworks.tw) this fall. Stay tuned and we will launch
at [Lab Made](http://www.labmade.com.hk/) on Christmas.

### Books, Music and Movies

year:

### All I Have Forgotten

There might be many things that I have forgotten. Here's a place holder.

2015
----

"Is it over?"

"Yeah, you are done." That's the last words I remember when walking out
of the highly prestigious company after the final round of the
interview. I knew I had little chance. That company was more selective
than Google, and I did not perform well. Had I just failed, again?

*Oops*. I thought.

I wish I would able to go back in time for just a few days, or just a
few hours, or even just a few seconds, to correct just one small
mistakes. If I had ever been able to do that once, everything would have
been totally different. But, you know, physics is physics, and following
the rules is important.

And certainly, for most of the times, I enjoyed everything. I learned
from people who were better than me.

I love my days of TEDActive in Whistler. People talked with me about
recycling bags, about how to produce nearly no garbage, and above all,
about their dreams of life, and about the world. I remember we talked
about artificial intelligence and consciousness. "Maybe machines need to
have death in order for them to realize their existence." An old man
said.

I enjoyed Hacker School (now it is called Recurse Center), where I made
many open source projects related to functional programming and also
miniKanren. "You are really good at everything you have worked on, so
don't feel too bad about rejections." One of my friends said.

I learned a lot from the days this fall when I was in Rome, Florence,
Naples, in San Marino, in Dubrovnik, Zadar, in Athens, in Valencia,
Barcelona, in Marrakech, Fez, in Dakar, in Salvador, in Port of Spain,
in San Jose, and La Fortuna. Locals and travelers made my days.

I received a lot of comments for my open source projects, including
Reread, Figure and "microKanren in miniKarnen". "Thanks for writing
this." I remember one people sent this with his or her comments.

I met a girl on the ship, who went to university when she was 14. She
talked with me about her friends, and her classmates who have already
become millionaires. I went to Thiel Summit, and met people who had been
building successful startups when they were 18. They didn't feel proud
of that, nor want to show that off to other people. "Many people are
still better than me." It felt like they were saying. And I admired
them, and was glad that I met them.

Well, but still, people say, "you are done."

It was the year when I quit Innohat, after graduating from the largest
startup accelerator in Asia. It was complicated why it failed, and I
wrote a whole reflection series of that.

I also missed a lot of opportunities, wasted a lot of resources, and
spent a lot of time doing useless things.

However, I guess, that just means there's still many things to be done.

I failed many proposals and applications, so I tried to do one with my
friends. We spent a week to polish the proposal for which I would
usually spend three hours. I asked her about how she did so many good
proposals. "I just spend enough time to make them appeal to me." She
said.

Probably there's still something simple that I should have already
known, although there's no simple way to learn simple things, I guess.

*I am still not done.*
