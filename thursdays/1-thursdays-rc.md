title: Thursdays and RC
subtitle: After My Last Presentation at Recurse Center.
---

*August 13, 2015*

It is my last day at [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com). Faculties are
setting up the projector, and a few minutes later, I will do my last
Thursday Presentation here.

I heard of the idea of Thursday Presentations the first week I came to
RC. It is simple -- each Thursday, people sign up and present things
they have built or learned. I nearly missed the first one, for that I
fear to speak publicly. However, after some mental struggling, I was
presenting, people were laughing, and everything went well. I continued
to present for the second week, and the third week, just about things I
built and learned. I felt I benefited from it a lot, and it resulted in
a little echo and inspiration in other people's mind. As a result, for
the twelve weeks I'm in RC, I presented twelve times.

And I want to continue it, so as people usually do when they decided to
commit on something, I created this blog. There will be a post every
other Thursday talking about things I learned and built in the past two
weeks, just as how Thursday Presentations at RC works.
